This project is getting, clicking and verifying few information from https://akamaijobs.referrals.selectminds.com/ website.
To do so I used Intellij, Java, Maven and Selenium Webdriver to implement, execute software and interact with the Chrome browser.

Tools which I used are:
1) chrome version 68.0.3440.75
2) chromedriver version 2.41.578737

Moreover I set up my test with chromedriver stored under following path: 
"C:\chromedriver.exe"

To execute following project, it is needed to type in Intellij terminal following maven command:
>> mvn clean install
